# What is Metaflux?
Metaflux is an open-source library providing tools that allow easy adoption of the flux (observable) pattern in your code which simplifies complex UI, easy debugging and unit-testing.
- Easy to write web components with or without shadow DOM
- API to handle your storage in an organized way
- Support in all major browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera)

# Persistence
the persistence of UI state simplifies effects of many event-emitting components in your application which can quickly become a tangled web using other patterns like MVC or MVVM

# Easy UI unit testing
With persistent state and actions following the flux pattern, it makes it easy to place a UI into a given state, call an action and verify the resulting state.

# Flexible
Metaflux works in any javascript environment and provides relief for developers wanting to follow web standards like es6 and web components without loading large and opinionated frameworks and libraries like React.
