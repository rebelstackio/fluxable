Metaflux is an open-source library providing tools that allow easy adoption of the flux (observable) design pattern in your code.

Flux simplifies complex UI, eases debugging and unit-testing. If you need to unit-test your UI state or have multiple inter-relations between state and UI elements in your application, then Flux can help you.
